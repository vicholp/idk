# Resources

Here you can define the front-end side of your application.

## JS

Inside the `js` folder, you will find a fully working Vue app.

You can use it as a starting point.

## PHP

Inside the `php` folder, you can define the static views of your application. 
There is no template engine, so if you want to build something fancy, go to the `js` 
folder, and use these to display the base component. 

You can pass variables to the `.php` files with the `view()` method of the `Controller` class.
This is not fully implemented yet, and not tested enough, so use it with caution.
