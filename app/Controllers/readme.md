# Controllers

Here you can define the controllers that your application implements.

All classes should extend `Controller` class. Then, you can define as many function as you want, 
and you can use the functions `ok()`, and `json()` to format the response of your function. If
this is not enough, you can use the full power of the `Response` class.

Also, this is the best place to document your OpenApi.
